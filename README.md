# MegmentationNetwork

MegmentationNetwork is a deep learning-based segmentation network designed for polygonal annotations. It is built using PyTorch and is intended for use in tasks involving image segmentation with polygonal masks.

## Features

- **Efficient Segmentation**: Uses a customized segmentation model for accurate polygonal mask predictions.
- **Image Augmentation**: Integrated with `albumentations` for robust data augmentation.
- **Training Pipeline**: Includes a full training pipeline with metrics monitoring (IoU, Precision, Recall).
- **Visualization Tools**: Automatically generates visualizations for class distributions and annotated images.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the provided `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the model, run:

```bash
python basic_network/train.py
```

### Command Line Script

If you have installed the package, you can use the provided command-line tool:

```bash
megmentation
```

This will execute the main training script.
