# basic_network/__init__.py

# Import any modules or classes you want to expose to the outside world
# For example:
# from .network import Network

# You can also define any initialization code here if needed

# Optionally, you can define the __all__ variable to specify which symbols
# should be imported when someone uses the `from basic_network import *` syntax
# For example:
# __all__ = ['Network']
